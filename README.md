# Vehicle Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of a vehicle dataset collected from CarDekho. The dataset includes various attributes related to vehicle specifications, prices, and ownership details. The analysis aims to extract meaningful insights from the data to understand trends, patterns, and factors influencing vehicle prices and depreciation.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collected the vehicle dataset from CarDekho.
- Preprocessed the dataset using pandas for data cleaning and preparation for analysis.

## Analysis and Insights

### 1. Manufacturing Years Range
- Identified the range of manufacturing years for vehicles in the dataset.

### 2. Price Distribution
- Examined the lowest and highest selling prices of vehicles to understand the price distribution.

### 3. Data Quality
- Counted the total number of records and identified any missing records to assess data quality.

### 4. Vehicle Diversity
- Determined the number of different vehicles present in the dataset.
- Identified the most sold vehicle.

### 5. Fuel Type and Seller Analysis
- Analyzed the number of CNG vehicles.
- Counted vehicles for sale directly from individuals.

### 6. Transmission and Ownership
- Counted the number of automatic transmission vehicles.
- Analyzed the number of single-person-owned vehicles.

### 7. Depreciation Analysis
- Calculated vehicle depreciation to identify the most and least cost-depreciated vehicles.
- Analyzed brands less affected by depreciation.

### 8. Factors Affecting Depreciation
- Conducted a correlation analysis to determine factors affecting cost depreciation.
- Examined the correlation of selling price with vehicle age and distance driven.

### 9. Newest Vehicles
- Analyzed the newest vehicles manufactured after 2014.

### 10. Vehicle Type Analysis
- Extracted data specifically for two-wheelers and cars.
- Identified the oldest, newest, and most sold bikes and cars.
- Analyzed deals in two-wheelers and cars that exceeded general expectations.

## Visualizations
- Created visualizations to provide clear insights and support informed decision-making:
  - Price distribution histograms
  - Bar charts for depreciation analysis
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Sales analysis bar charts
  - Vehicle type-specific visualizations

## Additional Analysis Questions

### 1. Brand Value Retention
- Determined which vehicle brand has the highest average resale value to understand brand value retention over time.

### 2. Fuel Efficiency
- Analyzed the average mileage of vehicles based on fuel type (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, Electric) to provide insights into the efficiency of different fuel-powered vehicles.
